# The Ghostty configuration format does not typically include
# indexed_colors 16 and 17 as separate entries like Alacritty,
# as those are usually handled by the 256 color palette.
# If you needed them, they would be defined as custom colors if Ghostty
# allowed an extended palette, but we stick to the 16 core colors here.
